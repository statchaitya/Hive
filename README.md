# Hive

Collection of my work in Hive. 

Most of it is a project from course for BUAN 6346 BIG DATA ANALYTICS | university Masters level course. The project takes in a complex unstructured Dallas Crime Data. Loads in onto a local cluster and then wrangles the data to create time series from it for different metrics. I've also added an option to just tell the script for how much years/months we want the data for. The script goes in and retrieves the required data.
